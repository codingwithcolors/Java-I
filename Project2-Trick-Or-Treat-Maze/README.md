## Group project for CSCI 1583 - Intro to Java
Collaborators: Dominique Ketchens and Amber Williams

This is a two week Java group project to create additional features from a maze game demo. We decided to turn the demo into a spooky Halloween adventure in celebration of the season. It was a fun challenge and we hope you enjoy our game!
