# Zombie Apocalypse Game

## First project for CSCI 1583 - Intro to Java:
This is a three week Java project that was introduced in the beginning of the semester. It was great to experiment with different game design features and challenges in this simple retro text game.

Original base zombie game demo by Ted Holmberg.

## Introduction
In this text adventure, you play as an adventurer who has gone far too deep in the dungeons. Now you have to try to go back up to the top floor and escape. You have a limited supply of food, weapons, and keys. Can you escape?

## How to Play the Game:
- Compile and run the "ZombieApocalypse" file.
- Control the player "@" by entering either: w, a, s, or d.
- Hurry to the exit "#".
- Avoid the zombies "+".
- Pickup weapons "^" to fight against the zombies.
- Pickup keys "$" to unlock the exit doors.
- Pickup food "&" to deter hunger.

## Helpful tips:
- Unlike the player, the zombies can wrap around the map. Avoid the edges whenever possible.
- Weapons are dropped once the player advances to the next level. Use them while you can.
- Zombies will chase the player up the levels. Try to get rid of them or create as much distance without starving.
- Zombies can destroy helpful resources. Pay attention to the text prompts.
- Keep track of your hunger.
- If the game is not moving, make sure the commands are single letter inputs without any additional spaces or other characters.
