# Java-I
 Projects created in my CSCI 1583 Introduction to Java course at the University of New Orleans with Dr. Banerjee.

## Project 1 - Zombie Apocalypse Text Game
A text adventure game about a player escaping a dungeon and trying not to be eaten by zombies along the way. This was the first Java project I had created during this course.

## [Project 2 - Trick Or Treat Maze Game](https://github.com/codingwithcolors/Java-I/tree/main/Project2-Trick-Or-Treat-Maze)
An maze adventure game about a trick or treater trying to find their way back home and avoiding any scary ghosts along the way. A two week collaboration group project between Dominique Ketchens (@codingwithcolors) and Amber Williams (@ambb99).
